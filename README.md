Connect any MIDI device to any other MIDI device. No more need for a DAW to connect MIDI devices.
It supports port remapping, automatic return tracks, sync toggle and saving/loading configurations.

The project is currently a work in progress, but relatively stable and used daily.

```bash
pip install rtmidi
pip install tkinter
python main.py
```
