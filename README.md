Connect any MIDI device to any other MIDI device. DAWs are heavy and surprisingly not as flexible when it comes to MIDI routing.
This Python based application supports port remapping, automatic return patches, sync toggle and saving/loading configurations.

The project is currently a work in progress, but relatively stable and used daily. It depends on `tkinter` and `rtmidi`.

## Start
```bash
python main.py
```

Todo:
- Better file structure and dependency management
